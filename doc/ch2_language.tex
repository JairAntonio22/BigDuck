\section{General Overview}
\subsection{Language Name}
\paragraph{} The for the programming language was given as a small joke, one of
the homeworks on the semester was to develop a scanner and parser for a small
language called LittleDuck. Therefore BigDuck could be considered as the next
step for the previous mentioned language, even though there is no similarities
but the name between these languages.

\paragraph{} Additionaly to this, I really like birds and use them as a naming
scheme for my devices, thus the decision seemed natural and adecuate.

\subsection{Main Features Description}
\paragraph{} BigDuck is language aimed for the developement of mathematical
models commonly used in Machine-Learning and Data Science. Therefore this
language includes integer and floating point arithmetic, vector and matrix
operations, and some basic utilities for reading and writing \texttt{.csv} 
iles. All this to make it easier for the user to work within the
Machine-Learning and Data Science fields.
